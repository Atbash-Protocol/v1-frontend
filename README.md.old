**Pull Requests**:
Each PR into `main` will get its own custom URL that is visible on the PR page. QA & validate changes on that URL before merging into the deploy branch. 

## üëèüèΩ Contributing Guidelines 

We keep an updated list of bugs/feature requests in [Github Issues](https://github.com/Atbash-Protocol/v1-frontend/issues). 

Once you submit a PR, our CI will generate a temporary testing URL where you can validate your changes. Tag any of the gatekeepers on the review to merge them into master. 

*__NOTE__*: For big changes associated with feature releases/milestones, they will be merged onto the `develop` branch for more thorough QA before a final merge to `main`
